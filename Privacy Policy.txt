**Privacy Policy**
Last updated: September 29, 2025

### Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the game *Infinifly*. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

### Data Collection
Infinifly does not directly collect, store, or share personal data with the developer.
The game does not use advertising, third-party logins, or external analytics.

However, to provide core features, the game relies on **Meta Quest platform services**, which may involve data collection managed entirely by Meta:

#### User ID and Profile
When you use the game, Meta may process:
* Oculus user ID
* Display name (gamertag / user profile name)

These are used exclusively to identify players on leaderboards and for cloud save synchronization. The developer does not access or store this information outside of the Meta platform.

#### Leaderboards
The game includes leaderboards managed by Meta. Meta may process:
* User ID and display name
* Score submissions and rankings

#### Cloud Storage
Game data and player progress may be stored locally and automatically synced to Metaâ€™s cloud storage.
This may include:
* Device identifiers
* App save files
* Local settings or progress

#### Platform Analytics
Meta may provide anonymized, aggregated analytics to the developer, such as:
* Number of users
* Device types and OS versions
* Regional distribution
* Session duration and performance metrics

These analytics contain no personally identifiable information.

### Internet Access and Permissions
Internet connectivity is required only to:
* Submit and retrieve leaderboard scores
* Sync cloud save data

No personal data is transmitted to the developer or to third parties outside of Meta.

### Data Deletion Requests
Because all personal data (User ID, profile name, scores, and save data) is processed by Meta, users may request data deletion directly through their Meta account settings:
[Meta Privacy Policy â€“ Data Rights](https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/)

If you have further questions, you may also contact the developer.

### Childrenâ€™s Privacy
*Infinifly* does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Any data processed is handled exclusively by Meta.

### Data Responsibility
The developer does not access, collect, or use any personal data from players. All data handling is managed by Meta according to their policies.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with a new revision date.
