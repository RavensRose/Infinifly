**Privacy Policy**
Last updated: October 1, 2025

### Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the game *Infinifly*. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

### Data Collection and Use
Infinifly does not directly collect, store, or share personal data with the developer.
The game does not use advertising, third-party logins, or external analytics.

However, to provide core features, the game relies on **Meta Quest platform services**, which process certain data on behalf of the developer:

#### User ID and Profile
When you use the game, Meta may process:
* Oculus user ID
* Display name (gamertag / user profile name)

#How this data is used:
*To display your name on in-game leaderboards
*To associate your scores and rankings with your account
*To synchronize your save data across devices via cloud storage

This data is not accessed, stored, or transmitted by the developer outside the Meta platform.

#### Leaderboards
Leaderboards are provided by Meta. To function, they process:
* User ID and display name
* Score submissions and rankings

#### Cloud Storage
Game progress may be stored locally and automatically synced via Metaâ€™s cloud service. This may include:
* Device identifiers
* App save files
* Local settings or progress

#### Platform Analytics
Meta may provide anonymized, aggregated analytics to the developer through the Developer Dashboard, including:
* Number of users
* Device types and OS versions
* Regional distribution
* Session duration and performance metrics

These reports do not contain personally identifiable information.

### Internet Access and Permissions
Internet connectivity is required only to:
* Submit and retrieve leaderboard scores
* Sync cloud save data

No personal data is transmitted to the developer or to third parties outside of Meta.

### Data Deletion Requests
Because all personal data (User ID, profile name, scores, and save data) is processed by Meta on behalf of the app, users may request data deletion directly,
you may request deletion of this data through:

Your Meta account settings â†’ Meta Privacy Policy â€“ Data Rights
Or by contacting the developer directly at ðŸ“§ ravensrosedev@gmail.com

Upon receiving a deletion request, the developer will work with Meta to ensure your data is deleted where applicable.

If you have further questions, you may also contact the developer.

### Childrenâ€™s Privacy
*Infinifly* does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Any data processed is handled exclusively by Meta.

### Data Responsibility
The developer does not access, collect, or use any personal data from players beyond what is processed by Meta platform features. All data handling is managed by Meta according to their policies.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted here with a new revision date.
