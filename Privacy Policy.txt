Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 29, 2025

Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the game Infinifly. We value your privacy and want to be transparent about how we handle your information.

Data Collection
Infinifly does not directly collect, store, or share any personal data or usage information with the developer.
The game does not use advertising, external login systems, or third-party analytics, and we do not transmit any player data outside of the Meta platform.

However, the game relies on standard Meta Quest platform services, which may involve data collection managed entirely by Meta:

Leaderboards: The game includes leaderboards provided by Meta Quest.
 In this process, Meta may collect and process:
  - Oculus user ID
  - Gamertag / display name
  - Score submissions and rankings

Cloud Storage: Game data and player progress may be stored locally on the device and automatically backed up to Metaâ€™s cloud storage.
This data is only used to enable proper game functionality. It may include:
 This may involve:
  - Device identifiers
  - App save files
  - Local settings or progress
  These files are stored on the userâ€™s device and may be synced to Metaâ€™s servers.

Internet Access and Permissions
Internet access may be required solely to:
  - Submit and retrieve leaderboard scores
  - Sync cloud save data
No data is shared with the developer or third parties outside the Meta platform.

Platform Analytics
Meta may provide aggregated, anonymized analytics to the developer via the Meta Developer Dashboard.
This may include:
  - Total number of users
  - Regional distribution (by country)
  - Device types and OS versions
  - Session duration and performance metrics

These analytics do not include personal user data or identifiable information, and are used only to improve the game and understand general usage trends.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy
Infinifly does not knowingly collect personal information from children. 
Any data processed through Metaâ€™s services (e.g., save files or leaderboard entries) is handled exclusively by Meta in accordance with their own policies.

Data Responsibility
The developer does not access or use any personal data collected or processed by Meta services. For information on how Meta handles user data, please refer to the [Meta Privacy Policy](https://www.meta.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new revision date.
